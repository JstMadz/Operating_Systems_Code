# Operating_Systems_Code

I taught myself about operating systems by studying "Operating System Concepts
Essentials (Second Edition)", by Abraham Silberschatz, Peter Baer Galvin and
Greg Gagne.

My study entailed reading the entire textbook, and completing all of the
programming problems and projects.  I completed these exercises in an instance
of the Linux virtual machine provided on the course website
http://cs.westminstercollege.edu/~greg/osc/index.html.
This GitHub repository contains my solutions to the exercises in the
"Essentials" textbook.

I had a lot of fun doing this, and consider operating systems knowledge
essential to all software engineers, since the operating system is the puppet
master of all user processes.
