# Operating_Systems_Code

I taught myself about operating systems by studying "Operating System Concepts
Essentials (Second Edition)", by Abraham Silberschatz, Peter Baer Galvin and
Greg Gagne.

My study entailed reading the entire textbook, and completing all of the
programming problems and projects. This link contains the base source code 
for some of the problems and projects:

I completed these exercises in an instance of the Linux virtual machine 
provided on a related course website:
http://cs.westminstercollege.edu/~greg/osc10e/vm/index.html

Unfortunately the exact course website does not provide a virtual machine.
Nonetheless, I had no trouble using the virtual machine provided on the
related course website.

I had a lot of fun going through the book, and consider operating systems
knowledge essential to all software engineers, since the operating system
is the puppet master of all user processes.
