# Operating_Systems_Code

I taught myself about operating systems by studying "Operating System Concepts
Essentials (Second Edition)", by Abraham Silberschatz, Peter Baer Galvin and
Greg Gagne.

My study will entail reading the entire textbook (am currently on Chapter 5),
and completing all of the programming problems and projects. This link
contains the base source code for some of the problems and projects:

I completed the exercises in an instance of the Linux virtual machine 
provided on a related course website:
http://cs.westminstercollege.edu/~greg/osc10e/vm/index.html

Unfortunately the exact course website does not provide a virtual machine.
Nonetheless, I had no trouble using the virtual machine provided on the
related course website.

I've had a lot of fun going through the book so far, and consider operating 
systems knowledge essential to all software engineers, since the operating
system is the puppet master of all user processes.
