# Operating_Systems_Code

I taught myself about operating systems by studying "Operating System Concepts
Essentials (Second Edition)", by Abraham Silberschatz, Peter Baer Galvin and
Greg Gagne.

My study entailed reading the entire textbook, and completing all of the
programming problems and projects.  I completed these exercises in an instance
of the Linux virtual machine provided on the course website
http://cs.westminstercollege.edu/~greg/osc10e/vm/index.html. This virtual
machine actually belongs to the tenth edition of "Operating System Concepts" (by
the same authors). I could not find the .ova file associated with my exact
version of the textbook, but the virtual machine generated by the above link was
perfectly suitable, since the exercises in the two textbooks are very similar.
This GitHub repository contains my solutions to the exercises in the
"Essentials" textbook.

I had a lot of fun doing this, and consider operating systems knowledge
essential to all software engineers, since the operating system is the puppet
master of all user processes.
